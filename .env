# Environment variables for Docker Compose

# --- Path Configuration ---
# IMPORTANT: Set this to the ABSOLUTE path on your host machine where
# the 'data' and 'config' subdirectories for the node will be stored.
# Docker will attempt to create these directories if they don't exist.
# Example Linux/macOS: TARGET_PATH=/srv/wesendit_node
# Example Windows: TARGET_PATH=C:/wesendit_node
# Ensure Docker has write permissions to this path.
TARGET_PATH=/path/to/your/wesendit/node/files

# --- Port Configuration ---
# Host port for P2P / Master connection (maps to 41631 in container)
OUTWARD_PORT=41631

# Host port for Frontend / Local connection (maps to 41630 in container)
FRONTEND_PORT=41630
